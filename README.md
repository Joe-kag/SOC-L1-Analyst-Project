### Defensive Security Fundamentals 🔒🛡

Covers core functions of defensive security, including:

Security Operations Center (SOC) roles and responsibilities

Cyber risk management and threat modeling

Security ticketing and incident tracking

### Log Analysis 📜🔍

Focuses on analyzing logs to detect security events:

Windows Event Logs analysis

SIEM fundamentals and log correlation

Incident response based on log patterns

### Host-Based Detection 🖥️🔎🛑

Extends log analysis to detect threats at the endpoint level:

Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools

Persistence mechanisms in Windows environments

Local and domain-based authentication events

### Network-Based Detection 🌐📡⚠️

Analyzes network traffic for anomalies and malicious activity:

Identifying network observables and indicators of compromise (IoCs)

Web activity logs and network packet analysis

Detecting and analyzing spearphishing attacks

### Installation & Setup ⚙️🔧🖥️

Step-by-step setup for the tools used in this project:

Install Wazuh SIEM and configure log forwarding

Set up Elastic Stack for log processing and visualization

Deploy The Hive for incident management

Configure Linux-based monitoring for endpoint security

### Use Cases 🎯🔍🚨

### Use Case 1: Suspicious Authentication Event 🏴‍☠️🔓⚠️

Detect failed login attempts in Windows Event Logs

Correlate logs with SIEM to identify brute force attempts

Investigate user behavior and take remediation actions

### Use Case 2: Spearphishing Attack Detection 📧🐟🚨

Analyze email headers and attachments for phishing indicators

Identify network traffic anomalies using Elastic Stack

Respond using The Hive for incident tracking and mitigation

### Use Case 3: Malware Execution on Endpoint 🦠💻🔍

Monitor process execution logs in Wazuh

Detect persistence mechanisms using Windows security logs

Isolate the affected host and conduct forensic analysis
